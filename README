Bitomail
--------

Bitomail allows you to operate BitMessage with an e-mail client. It is in
a stage of a working proof of concept. Currently, Bitomail contains two
scripts:

* unread2mbox.rb
* mbox2send.rb

unread2mbox.rb prints all unread BitMessages in a UNIX mbox format and marks
them as read in BitMessage.

mbox2send.rb sends each mail in UNIX mbox provided on STDIN as BitMessages.
Prints ackData for each message successfully sent.

You need to edit both scripts in order to serve your needs. Bitomail has no
configuration files at the moment.
